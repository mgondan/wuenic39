Belize	Wed Sep 06 18:39:33 2023	blz	rcv1	2021	79	79	2						7186	7186				R:	Estimate based on estimated MCV1.   Reported number of doses decreased by about 9 percent for most vaccine-doses recommended in infancy between 2020 and 2021. However, this decline in number of children vaccinated is not reflected in the reported coverage because the reported denominator was also lower by about 10 percent in 2021. Thus, WUENIC might be overestimating true coverage.  GoC=R+ D+
