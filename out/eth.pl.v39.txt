National programme reports deficiencies in the accuracy of the administrative reporting system. An electronic HMIS was implemented in several regions during 2011-12 with national roll-out on-going in 2013. Reported coverage levels reflect an adjustment to the administrative coverage levels, based on the results of a DQS conducted in 2013. WHO and UNICEF encourage a revision of the reported time series of coverage data.  During 2013, the national immunization programme has implemented a programme improvement plan. During 2013, the number of health centres and health posts increased as did the number of health extension workers in health posts. Observed decreases in the number of children vaccinated between 2012 and 2013 are believed to reflect improved recording and reporting rather than a true decline in service delivery. The official government estimate is based on the application of a verification factor from a 2013 DQS applied to HMIS coverage levels.  GoC=Assigned by working group. .
