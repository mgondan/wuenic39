A decline in the reported number of doses for most vaccines compared to the previous fiscal year is not reflected in the reported coverage. The United Kingdom utilizes a child health information system to estimate vaccination coverage for the routine childhood immunization coverage. The system has been described in Amirthalingam and colleagues (2012) publication available online at: http://www.eurosurveillance.org. Studies show that population-based coverage data generated from computerised child health information systems (CHISs) under-estimate the numerator due to not all information being shared between systems.
