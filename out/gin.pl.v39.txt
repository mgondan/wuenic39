Programme reports subnational stockouts of all vaccines shown here. Programme has reviewed and revised administrative data for 2015-19 and notes efforts to continue improving data quality. The country has expressed interest to WHO and UNICEF for support on improving data quality in the near future.  Estimate challenged by: D-R-

Estimates may not reflect actual changes in coverage as reported number of administered doses declined from 2019 to 2020. However, reported numerator and denominators have been inconsistent over time. Official coverage for the last three years follows an upwards trend, while administrative coverage and number of children vaccinated follows a declining trend for all vaccines recommended after birth.

Reported official coverage reflects adjustments that take into account outbreaks and stockouts of vaccine and syringes. However, further documentation is not provided. WHO and UNICEF encourage a data review alongside improvements to the immunization service delivery.Reported data excluded due to sudden change in coverage from 60 level to 47 percent.  No nationally representative household survey within the last 5 years. WHO and UNICEF recommend a high-quality survey to confirm reported levels of coverage. The country conducted several catch-up activities during 2022 to reduce immunity gaps in persons that had been previously missed. The added proportion of infants from the 2021 cohort who were vaccinated in 2022 varied from 1.2 percent for BCG to 3.8 percent for measles. However, reported coverage shown here do not reflect the contribution of these catch-up activities. Programme reports a four months vaccine stockout at national and subnational levels.
