Programme reports 71 percent coverage in 53 percent of the national target population. Estimate is based on the total annual national target population.  Programme notes their official estimates are based on actual deliveries as the administrative coverage is based on projections from the 2010 census. Adjustment of official estimate from administrative coverage is based on the number of actual deliveries rather than a projection from the 2010 census. However, the one-time use of actual deliveries as the target population rather than the projections from the census creates a slight discontinuity that is reflective of a data correction rather than a change in programme performance.

Given the differences between survey results and reported data, estimates are likely overestimated.
