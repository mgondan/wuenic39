Libya	Wed Sep 06 18:54:34 2023	lby	rotac	2019	73	73	1	96	97	97	237509	247510	123055	123055	97	gov		W:	 WHO and UNICEF have highlighted the impact of ongoing civil conflict and instability on children, particularly those residing in Tripoli, Derna and urban areas in the west and south (see UN News, https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055492). WHO and UNICEF have noted severe disruptions to the health system, including immunization service delivery and availability of essential medicines (see Lancet. 2014;387:1363 and Lancet. 2018;391:824-5). While reports suggest these disruptions have been ongoing for several years, unfortunately, available data that quantifies the magnitude and onset of the disruption of health service delivery are scarce. Programme reports three months vaccine stockout at national and sub-national levels. Using this information and a strong assumption that immunization services were severely disrupted during the vaccine stockout, the estimate is based on a 25 percentage point reduction in coverage consistent with the duration of the stockout.

Available data to quantify the magnitude of the disruption of health service delivery are scarce. Programme reports three months vaccine stockout at national and sub-national levels. As done for previous years, using this information and a strong assumption that immunization services have been severely disrupted during the vaccine stockout, the estimate is based on a 25 percentage point reduction in coverage consistent with the duration of the stockout.

Available data to quantify the magnitude of the disruption of health service delivery are scarce. Programme reports three months vaccine stockout at national and sub-national levels. As done for previous years, using this information and a strong assumption that immunization services have been severely disrupted during the vaccine stockout, the estimate is based on a 25 percentage point reduction in coverage consistent with the duration of the stockout.  Programme reports two months vaccine stockout at national and subnational levels.  Estimate challenged by: D-R-

As done for previous years, using this information and a strong assumption that immunization services have been severely disrupted during the vaccine stockout, the estimate is based on a 25 percentage point reduction in coverage consistent with the duration of the stockout.  Despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis, reported coverage levels have been sustained. Government indicates that official estimates are derived from the administrative coverage based on the average of previous years. In 2021, reports indicated that up to 90 percent of primary health care (PHC) were closed in some areas (WHO Appeal for Libya 2023 who.int/emergencies/funding/outbreak-and-crisis-response-appeal/2023/2023-appeals/appeal-libya). No nationally representative household survey within the last 5 years. WHO and UNICEF recommend a high-quality survey to confirm reported levels of coverage, as the situation permits.
