In April 2008 Sri Lanka withdrew DTP-HepB-Hib pentavalent vaccine as a precautionary measure following reports of serious adverse events. Subsequent investigation of the reported adverse events and a review of the vaccine quality by WHO concluded that there was no evidence of increased safety risk associated with the vaccine. The suspension of the vaccine led to a high proportion of parents seeking Hib immunization for their children in the private sector. Reporting by the private sector is not complete. Nationally reported estimates have been adjusted to levels of measles coverage provided in the public sector.  GoC=R+ D+

Reported target population declined 12 percent from 2021 to 2022. Reported data also suggest year to year declines in the number of doses administered that are not reflected in reported coverage. WHO and UNICEF are aware of rolling district level coverage assessments in the country. Nonetheless, the programme is encouraged to conduct a nationally representative independent assessment to validate the continued high performance levels.  GoC=R+ D+

In April 2008 Sri Lanka withdrew DTP-HepB-Hib pentavalent vaccine as a precautionary measure following reports of serious adverse events. Subsequent investigation of the reported adverse events and a review of the vaccine quality by WHO concluded that there was no evidence of increased safety risk associated with the vaccine. The suspension of the vaccine led to a high proportion of parents seeking Hib immunization for their children in the private sector. Reporting by the private sector is not complete. Nationally reported estimates have been adjusted to levels of measles coverage provided in the public sector.  GoC=R+ D+
