Survey evidence of 82 percent based on 1 survey(s).  Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey 2015-2016 card or history results of 67 percent modifed for recall bias to 82 percent based on 1st dose card or history coverage of 90 percent, 1st dose card only coverage of 45 percent and 3rd dose card only coverage of 41 percent.  Reported coverage levels for 2014 computed using target population data from preliminary 2014 census results.  GoC=Assigned by working group.  In spite of what appear to be inconsistent reported number of children vaccinated and target population suggesting problems with the recording and monitoring system and/or incomplete reporting, the results of the 2015-16 Demographic and Health Survey support reported coverage levels. However, there is concern that less than half of the survey results are derived from documented evidence.
