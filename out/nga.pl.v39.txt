Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2021 results ignored by working group.

Country notes progress from levels observed in the 2016-17 MICS/NICS. These improvements can be seen in the 2018 NDHS results.Reported data excluded due to an increase from 61 percent to 80 percent with decrease 60 percent.  During 2015-2019, the Government of Nigeria implemented numerous activities to improve the reach and quality of service delivery, including the Optimized Integrated Routine Immunization Sessions (OIRIS), improvements that tend to be reflected in improved coverage levels that are supported by results of DHS and MICS surveys.

Official reported coverage informed by the survey result for the youngest annual cohort (the 2020 cohort) from the 2021 MICS/NICS survey. Government has indicated that the 2021 official coverage estimate is also based on survey results, though there are discrepancies with their reported coverage for 2021 and 2022 vis-a-vis survey results. For antigens with reported administrative data in 2022, there is the appearance of increases in the number of doses administered from levels reported for 2021; however, it remains unclear whether the transition to DHIS2 has matured sufficiently to monitor trends in coverage. Alongside continued implementation of the national data quality improvement plan activities, WHO and UNICEF encourage continued efforts to independently assess the quality of the administrative recording and reporting system at all levels.
