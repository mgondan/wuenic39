The Somali Health and Demographic Survey 2020 results ignored by working group.  Lower vaccination coverage levels suggested by the survey for the 2017 cohort are consistent with challenges in funding around delivery of the countryÿs Essential Package of Health Services through the Somali Joint Health and Nutrition Program (JHNP), a multi-donor fund managed by UNICEF that aimed to strengthen the health system and service delivery across Somalia. The JHNP ended in December 2016. Survey results are based mostly on respondent recall of vaccination history given only four percent with available documented evidence in a home-based record. In contrast to prior surveys noted here, the 2017 survey incorporated three strata within the sampling process targeting urban, rural and nomadic communities. Exceptionally low vaccination coverage estimates among children residing in nomadic communities is observed and thus lowers the national coverage levels.Reported data excluded.  See comment in 2019.

Beginning in 2008, to complement weak routine immunization services, Somalia offers DTP to children less than one year of age through semi-annual Child Health Days (CHDs). Coverage reported by the Government of Somalia includes immunizations delivered through routine services as well as through CHDs. Because reported coverage is based only on documented immunizations some DTP1 doses may be second or third doses. While Somalia reports routine doses of DTP disaggregated by routine services and CHDs, no data were provided for the number of DTP1 doses delivered through routine services. The WHO and UNICEF estimate is based on the observed dropout between DTP1 and DTP3 in 2010 where data from both DTP1 and DTP3 were available. There is, however, considerable uncertainty of at least plus or minus 10 percentage points regarding coverage estimates due to uncertainty in the number of children in the target population, the most recent Somali census was conducted in 1987, and the difficulty of coordinating recording and reporting between CHD activities and routine services. It is important to note that immunizations provided through CHDs provide significant levels of protection against vaccine preventable diseases and are an important strategy in reaching children in this still fragile state.

Beginning in 2008, to complement weak routine immunization services, Somalia offers DTP to children less than one year of age through semi-annual Child Health Days (CHDs). Coverage reported by the Government of Somalia includes immunizations delivered through routine services as well as through CHDs. Because reported coverage is based only on documented immunizations some DTP1 doses may be second or third doses. While Somalia reports routine doses of DTP disaggregated by routine services and CHDs, no data were provided for the number of DTP1 doses delivered through routine services. The WHO and UNICEF estimate is based on the observed dropout between DTP1 and DTP3 in 2010 where data from both DTP1 and DTP3 were available. There is, however, considerable uncertainty of at least plus or minus 10 percentage points regarding coverage estimates due to uncertainty in the number of children in the target population, the most recent Somali census was conducted in 1987, and the difficulty of coordinating recording and reporting between CHD activities and routine services. It is important to note that immunizations provided through CHDs provide significant levels of protection against vaccine preventable diseases and are an important strategy in reaching children in this still fragile state.
