Survey evidence of 75 percent based on 1 survey(s).    The Republic of South Sudan became an independent state and was admitted to the United Nations and became a WHO member state in July 2011. Access to health facilities is a problem in many parts of the country for five months out of the year. The official government estimates for 2011 are based on the number of children vaccinated (administrative reports) and the highest denominator possible as derived from the five birth cohorts reached in Polio SIAs. The resulting official estimate is much lower than the administrative estimates because of the marked differences in denominators used. Please note that the this method of official estimation of coverage in South Sudan was used because of the consistent under-estimation of the denominators derived from the 2008 housing and population census that were used in earlier years.. Official government estimate based on immunization programme targets.  Estimate challenged by: D-R-

The 51 percent increase in reported doses administered is of such magnitude that it requires validation before being considered a trustworthy year-to-year value. Reported data excluded.  Country reports that due to instability in the country, there is a large population movement in and out of the country which affects the denominator. Country reports ongoing uncertainty in the target population due to instability and substantial population movement in and out of the country. Reported increases in coverage from 2020 reflect a decline in the reported target population and an apparent increase in the number of children vaccinated which perhaps is an artefact of poor recording and reporting noted in prior years. Estimate of 69 percent changed from previous revision value of 50 percent.  Estimate challenged by: D-R-

Across the time-series, estimate may overestimate coverage as well as dropout for multi-dose antigens given concerns for quality of administrative recording and reporting system. Reported data excluded.  Country reports that due to instability in the country, there is a large population movement in and out of the country which affects the denominator. Country also notes issues related to the accuracy of the numerator such as high turn over of vaccination staff coupled with limited capacity in tallying, recording and reporting of immunization data. WHO and UNICEF encourage continued efforts to improve recording and monitoring, including a high quality survey, while the programme continues efforts to increase vaccination coverage.
