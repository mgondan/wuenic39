WHO and UNICEF observe that recent survey results suggest lower levels of coverage than that reported by the programme during the past 10 years. Further investigation to understand underlying differences is warranted, and WHO and UNICEF recommend a high-quality independent empirical assessment to confirm reported levels of coverage. Decline in reported coverage is unexplained by country but aligns with COVID-19 pandemic service disruptions.  Estimate challenged by: R-
